# Overview

## Basic Component

Firstly here you'll see the CSS wrote which will be attached in our component by CSS Modules.

```css
.link {
  color: palevioletred;
}
```

After having the CSS ready we should import it and attach to any component such as the Link component below:

```tsx
import styled from '@helloinnovation/styled'
import styles from './styles.module.css'

const Link = styled.a(styles.link)

const MyComponent = () => <Link>I'm a boring link</Link>
```

## Composition

Now let's see how it would work with composition. <br />
We're going to compose a LinkButton component with the previous Link component created in the last code section. <br />
The code should be like `styled(ComponentThatShouldBeComposed)(newCSSClass)` as the example below.

```css
.btn {
  border: 1px solid palevioletred;
  display: inline-flex;
  padding: 0.8rem 1.2rem;
}
```

```tsx
import styled from '@helloinnovation/styled'
import styles from './styles.module.css'

const LinkButton = styled(Link)(styles.btn)

const MyComponent = () => (
  <LinkButton>I'm a link that looks like a button</LinkButton>
)
```

## Variants

Variants are style rules which may change accordingly to it's values.
Here we have a boolean variant called `button` and if it's true, the class `styles.btn` will be attached to the DOM node.

```tsx
import styled from '@helloinnovation/styled'
import styles from './styles.module.css'

const Link = styled.a.variants({
  button: {
    true: styles.btn,
  },
})(styles.link)

const MyComponent = () => (
  <>
    <Link>I'm a boring link</Link>
    <Link button>I'm a link that looks like a button</Link>
  </>
)
```

So if you need a variant with severals values, here goes a code snippet:

```css
.red {
  color: red;
}

.blue {
  color: blue;
}

.orange {
  color: orange;
}
```

Now we'll apply this css as a variant.

```tsx
import styled from '@helloinnovation/styled'
import styles from './styles.module.css'

const Paragraph = styled.p.variants({
  color: {
    red: styles.red,
    blue: styles.blue,
    orange: styles.orange,
  },
})(styles.link)

Paragraph.defaultProps = {
  color: 'red',
}

const MyComponent = () => (
  <>
    <Paragraph>Red Paragraph</Paragraph>
    <Paragraph color="blue">Blue Paragraph</Paragraph>
    <Paragraph color="orange">Orange Paragraph</Paragraph>
  </>
)
```

In the example above, we also can check the use of `defaultProps`. Please, note that the default prop is the name of the className _`red`_, **never will be** `styles.red`.

## `as` property

It has the same behavior styled-component library also has. <br />
In some cases you might want to change which tag or component a component renders. This is common when building a navigation bar for example, where there are a mix of anchor links and buttons but they should be styled identically.
For this situation, we have an escape hatch. You can use the "as" polymorphic prop to dynamically swap out the element that receives the styles you wrote:

```tsx
import styles from './Button.module.css'

const Button = styled.button(/* */)

render(
  <div>
    <Button>Normal Button</Button>
    <Button as="a" href="#">
      Link with Button styles
    </Button>
  </div>
)
```
